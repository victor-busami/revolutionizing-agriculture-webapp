## Agriculture Analytics Platform

A comprehensive machine learning-based analytics platform designed to predict agricultural yields and optimize resource usage. This project is implemented in the `agric_analysis_training.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file, which includes end-to-end steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `agric_analysis_training.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all analysis steps including:

  - Data Loading: Uses `agriculture_dataset.csv` (should be in the same directory) with crop yield, season, and input data.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots) to understand variable distributions and detect outliers.
  - Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, applies scaling, and encodes categorical variables.
  - Modeling: Trains both Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.
  - Model Evaluation: Uses metrics such as RMSE and R¬≤ score to evaluate performance.
  - Insights: Summarizes findings including feature importance and seasonal impacts.

- `agriculture_dataset.csv`: The dataset containing agricultural yield data (not included‚Äîplease provide your own dataset).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üì• Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agriculture-analytics-platform.git
cd agriculture-analytics-platform
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Install Dependencies

The project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

To install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, you can install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## üìä How to Run the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `agric_analysis_training.ipynb`.
3. Run each cell sequentially:

   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform EDA to understand data distributions and patterns.
   - Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encoding, scaling).
   - Train and evaluate models.
   - Review the results including RMSE and R¬≤ scores.

## üîç Key Features and Functionality

- **Data Exploration:** Understand seasonal trends, identify outliers, and visualize variable relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans data and prepares it for modeling (e.g., using OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, RobustScaler).
- **Modeling:** Compares multiple regression models (Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor) for yield prediction.
- **Model Evaluation:** Includes RMSE and R¬≤ metrics with insights on model performance.
- **Feature Importance:** Highlights key variables that influence crop yield.
- **Seasonal Analysis:** Explores agricultural seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Zaid) and their impact on yield.

---

## üå± Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

This project aligns with:

- **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** ‚Äî Enhancing agricultural productivity through predictive analytics.
- **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** ‚Äî Optimizing resource use with data-driven insights.
- **SDG 13: Climate Action** ‚Äî Supporting climate-resilient agricultural practices.
- **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** ‚Äî Creating opportunities for agritech innovation.

# Team Collaboration Guide - Please Read Before Contributing!

## Hey Team! üëã

Welcome to our project! I've put together this guide to help everyone collaborate smoothly on our GitHub repository. Please take a few minutes to read through this - it'll save us all time and prevent headaches down the road.

## What You'll Need Before Starting

- Git installed on your machine (if you don't have it, grab it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com))
- Access to our GitHub repository (let me know if you need an invite)
- Basic Git knowledge (don't worry, I'll walk you through everything)
- **Python and Jupyter Notebook** installed. You can install using:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

---

## Working With Jupyter Notebooks (Without VS Code)

Since we‚Äôre using **Jupyter Notebooks** in this project, here‚Äôs how you can work with them directly from your terminal or command prompt (no need for VS Code):

### ‚úÖ After Cloning the Repository:

1. **Navigate into the project folder:**

```bash
cd repository-name
```

2. **Check if the Jupyter notebook is present:**

```bash
ls *.ipynb  # On Linux/Mac
# or
dir *.ipynb  # On Windows
```

If it‚Äôs missing or not listed, let the team know.

3. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook interface:**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new browser tab showing the notebook dashboard.

4. **Open the `.ipynb` file:**

   - Click on the notebook file to open it in your browser.
   - Make your changes carefully and test your cells.

5. **Save your work:**

   - Click `File > Save and Checkpoint`, or simply press `Ctrl + S`

6. **Close the notebook and stop the server:**

   - Once done, close the notebook tab.
   - Stop the Jupyter server by pressing `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.

7. **Stage and commit your changes:**

```bash
git add filename.ipynb
git commit -m "Update notebook with [your changes]"
```

8. **Push your branch to GitHub:**

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

> ‚úÖ **Avoid merge conflicts:**
>
> - Don‚Äôt edit the same notebook cell as someone else.
> - Always pull from `main` before editing.

## Our Team Workflow - Please Follow These Steps!

### Step 1: Get the Repository on Your Machine (First Time Only)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
```

### Step 2: ALWAYS Update Main First! (This is Super Important!)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Create Your Own Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-feature
```

**Branch naming tips:**

- `feature/description`
- `bugfix/what-you-fixed`
- `hotfix/urgent-fix`
- `docs/what-you-updated`

### Step 4: Do Your Magic! ‚ú®

- Edit your `.ipynb` file or Python code.
- Run cells to test and make sure everything works.

### Step 5: Save Your Work

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add amazing feature that does X and Y"
```

### Step 6: Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
```

### Step 7: Ask for a Code Review (Pull Request)

- Use GitHub to open a Pull Request.
- Fill in title, description, screenshots, and testing steps.

### Step 8: Work With Me on Reviews

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix review changes"
git push origin feature/your-awesome-feature
```

### Step 9: Celebrate and Clean Up üéâ

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/your-awesome-feature
git push origin --delete feature/your-awesome-feature
```

---

## Team Rules - Please Respect These!

### ‚ùå DON'T:

- Push directly to `main`
- Use `--force` on shared branches
- Commit secrets
- Upload huge files without asking

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Work on branches
- Pull main before edits
- Write clear commits
- Test code
- Keep PRs focused

---

## Useful Git Commands:

```bash
git status
git branch -a
git checkout branch-name
git log --oneline
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### Merge Conflict Help:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-branch
git merge main
# Fix conflicts, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin your-branch
```

### If Using a Fork:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository-name.git
git checkout main
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

---

## Quick Git + Notebook Cheat Sheet

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
# Launch Jupyter Notebook, edit your .ipynb
jupyter notebook
# Save and exit notebook
# Then:
git add your-notebook.ipynb
git commit -m "What you did"
